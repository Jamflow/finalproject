<P> To make the button, we used the < button > code. We gave it an ID, and a class. For the ID, we called it "taskButton", and for the clas we called it "generatorButtonStyle". The button is being used to create an insult. </p>
<p> To make the insult look clean and nice, we used the < div > code. This code defines a division or a section. In this case, it defines the section underneath the button, and that is where the insults show up, as well as creates a section for the button. </p>
<p> To get the font, we created a stylsheet that used CSS. We downloaded a font off Google, and referenced it. </p>
